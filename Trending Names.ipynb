You can read a nice summary of them in [this](https://www.fusioncharts.com/blog/best-python-data-visualization-libraries/) article. In this project I used [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) because it is not only suitable for plotting images, but it has a powerful interactive feature as well. At the end of this post you find all the links to the online visualization, where you can truly exlore the data in detail. I really encourage you to visit them, preferably from a desktop browser."
